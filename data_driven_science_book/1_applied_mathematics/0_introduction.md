# Applied Mathermatics

**Applied Mathematics** applies maths to a different field such as **Engineering**, **Computer Science**, **Physics**, **Biology**, **Finance**, and more. It consists of formulating and studying a practical problem using mathematical models.

In this Part, **Linear Algebra**, and others to come, are chosen. In these chapters, mathematical objects will be introduced through formalism, visual explanations, and Python code to guide towards direct real-world application examples of those concepts.
