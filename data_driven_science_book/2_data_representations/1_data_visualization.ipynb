    "Why should you care about **Data Visualization**? Scientists have to report their work to demonstrate their arguments as a research paper, poster presentation, a talk, client reports, and vulgarisation. In this sense, it is a requirement to make clear, attractive, and convincing data visualization. They play a central part in their communication and often carry the weight of an argumentation."
