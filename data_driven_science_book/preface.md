# Preface

The **Data-Driven Science TextBook** contains the reference material for the Data-Driven Science Lectures given at the [De Vinci Innovation Center](https://dvic.devinci.fr/).

**Data-Driven Science** is an **inter-disciplinary** field of Computer Science using scientific processes to extract knowledge from structured or unstructured data. The field concentrates on multiple hot science subfields such as **Big Data**, **Data Visualization**, **Data Sonification**, **Data Mining**, **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning** and more.

The fundamental sciences of **Linear Algebra**, **Statistics** and **Probabilities**, **Optimization**, and **Algorithmy**  are essential to the Data-Driven Sciences. This book does not aim at covering all of those fields in detail. It provides enough material to build interest for students in the Data-Driven Sciences field. In this sense, each chapter introduces the mathematical knowledge necessary to apply it to real-world applications.
