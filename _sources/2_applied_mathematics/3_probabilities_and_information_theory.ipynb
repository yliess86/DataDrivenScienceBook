    "# Probabilities and Information Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability Theory** is the study of probability and its interpretations through a set of rigorous mathematical formalism and axioms. It defines probability in terms of a probability space and probability measures between $0$ and $1$. In conjunction with Linear Algebra, Probability is one of the bases for Machine Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fundamentals of Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, the fundamental concepts of probability theory, **Random Experiments**, **Sets**, **Indepedence**, **Conditional Probability**, and **Baye's Rule** are discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Probability** of an **Event** , defined as the chance of its realization,  is encoded as a **Positive Real Numeral** between $0$ and $1$. Formally speaking, we first define a **Probability Space** composed of the three following components: a **Sample Space** $\\Omega$ representing all possible outcomes of an experiment, a set of possible **Events**, as well as a **Probability Function** $P$ measuring the chance of each event to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Note the $\\Omega$ contains itself but also the empty set of events $\\varnothing$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability function is defined such as it always respect the following requirements:\n",
    "- $P(\\varnothing)=0$\n",
    "- $P(\\Omega)=1$\n",
    "- $P(A \\cup B)=P(A) + P(B)$ for two disjoint events $A$ and $B$\n",
    "- $P(\\overline{A}) = 1 - P(A)$ with $\\overline{A}$ being the complement of the event $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us illustrate those concepts by comparing three random experiments by **Monte Carlo Simulation** in conjunction with the **Theroy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dice Rowling\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following experiment where two independant and non-pipped six-sided dices are rolled, and we want to find the probability of the both dice being odd. The problem can be formalised as follow:\n",
    "- $\\Omega = \\left \\{ 1, \\dots, 6  \\right \\}^2$\n",
    "- $A = \\left \\{ (i, j) \\; | \\; i + j \\; \\text{is odd} \\right \\}$\n",
    "- $P(B) = \\frac{|B|}{|\\Omega|}$ where $|.|$ denotes the number of element in the given set\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability function is symmetric and can be resumed in the following table:"
